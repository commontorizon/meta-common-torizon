Subject: [PATCH 2/2] mount: Allow building when macro LOOP_CONFIGURE is not
 available

This is to allow building the software on machines not having the macro
LOOP_CONFIGURE or the struct loop_config in header "linux/loop.h" (both
of which added to the kernel uapi at the same time); the code snippet
providing them was taken from package util-linux, source file
"include/loopdev.h".

Upstream-Status: Accepted [https://github.com/containers/composefs/pull/253]
